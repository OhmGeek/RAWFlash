Description: A summary of everything that happened over the summer with regards to the project.

## Items
### Processing RAW using libraw and dcraw
After researching into both of these libraries, they are both not ideal candidates for RAW processing.

#### Writing my own RAW reader
I initially considered writing my own RAW processor, either just for DNG or other formats too.

However, I decided against this method, due to the complex nature of the RAW format (or rather, the family of RAW formats). RAW is not one file format, but there are many formats. Each camera manufacturer has their own structure, and some cameras even provide more tags. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to keep this up to date. What might work with one camera, won't work with another. DNG was released by Adobe as a standard, but unfortunately it hasn't been adopted widely. Adobe do provide a converter to DNG though, but that only runs on either Windows or Mac, so for our use it doesn't provide much use (we can't convert to DNG using a separate server, and then read DNG for our image processing needs), as we need to be able to run our system on Linux machines (due to the nature of the cloud system we are designing).

#### LibRaw
This is an entirely C++ based library, designed for processing RAW images. It's compatible with both Windows, Mac and Linux. While it has an impressive feature set, it's quite a heavy library. Also, the documentation I found was somewhat lacking, including simple documentation on how to link it with other C++ projects, which became a problem when I tried writing some example code.

The lack of documentation, coupled with the heavy weight of the library, is why I decided against using this library for my project.

#### dcraw
This is a more common method of doing RAW processing. It's the executable used by many open source RAW image editors, including GIMP plugins, DarkTable, and RawTherapee. The only downside is that it isn't a library at all, but an executable. While the C code exists in its entirety online, it would be difficult to modify the code into a library thanks to use of global variables through the code. 

There are, however, several wrappers for other programming languages, such as 'NDCRaw' by AerisG222 for the .NET Framework. However, .NET is not really designed to run directly on Linux, which is the main OS for most web servers, due to licensing costs with Windows.

DCraw is still not the most ideal though, as it's an executable rather than a library, so therefore we cannot get the image output directly in a form within main memory, but instead we have to store it on hard disk and then read that output file. For speed, this isn't ideal as main memory is much faster than an HDD (or even an SSD). However, it's not easily avoidable. 
##### JDcraw
I therefore embarked on a project over summer called [JDCraw](https://github.com/OhmGeek/JDCRaw) which is a wrapper for the Java programming language, which is far more platform independent.

This library can be used to export the file from RAW (many different types, including DNG and NEF), to two possible file formats: PPM and TIFF. The former isn't really supported by many Java based image processing libraries, but the latter is more supported (at least with the standard tag structure).

In order to make sure that the library continues working throughout the year, I also wrote unit tests, achieving 74% code coverage according to codecov.io.

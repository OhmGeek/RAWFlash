## Implementing Haze Removal

There are several components to Haze Removal. The pre-requisite for this
is to write a fairly efficient Mean Blur operation. We have something that'll work,
but we might want to look into parallelising it if that'll work better.

### Guided Filter
This is one operation that is carried out within the process.

This has several parameters: radius (default 5), and epsilon (default 0.4). The description
here is based on a code sample written in Python, with OpenCV.

First, we need to separate the image channels, into Red, Green and Blue respectively.

For each colour channel, find the mean blur, using kernel size (r, r). This will produce three
output images: Ir_mean, Ig_mean, and I_b mean.

Now multiply different images together:

Irr_ = meanblur(Ir * Ir, kernel=(r, r)) - (Ir___mean * Ir_mean ) + epsilon

### RAM Disk
The current setup has a number of big issues, mostly revolving around hard disk usage being slow, and too many writes causing
problems with SSDs.

A solution is to use RAM Disk, which is easy to set up within Linux. If we eventually set up our server within a docker container,
this will allow us to improve our system with respect to speed.

### Adams Processor Update
As before, we are somewhat limited in terms of pipelining to actual files. This isn't the most ideal situation, as it would be
far better to pipeline buffered images, however it's our only option to allow for nice code modularity.

Therefore, we will need to write some routines to read/write files, and generate random filenames. This is still to be undertaken.

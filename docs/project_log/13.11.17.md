# Project Log
## Demo web client now in place
- Uses raw javascript, html and css.
- Needs a style upgrade
## Backend
- Uses Socket IO as an interface
- Need some type of web server/manager eventually for selected uploaded files/linking with GDrive/other storage services, logins, and deal with setting up the pages needed for editing (suggested to use Django for this because I know it well).

## TODO:
- Docker container (docker compose) for everything and a script to run the entire system as one
- More algorithms to be implmeneted, mostly more advanced and fun ones like Haze Removal, object removal, spot healing,
- Fix the Adams Processor pipeline glitch, where images become super dark over time.

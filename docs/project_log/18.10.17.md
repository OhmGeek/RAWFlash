Description: Improvements to the design and implementation

## Items
### File caching implementation
Filenames are now generated using UUIDs (Unique Universal Identifiers). While these, on their own, will not be useful in generating a new filename, we can use a random seed as the URL to generate a random filename. This means that we can first find the UUID, and if the file itself exists, rather than copying the file again, we can use the cached edition.

Speed wise, I haven't yet collected information before/after caching, but it's quite substantial (as copying over potentially 32MB images every single time we want to edit it, is slow). TODO: Get results for this, to include in our write up/design.


#### Assumptions:
 - the RAW file itself will not change at all. It's a Digital Negative.
 - One URL maps to one unique identifiable image
 - URLs include the file extension.

#### Drawbacks:
 - if a url is used that doesn't contain the file extension, we currently will just throw an error.
 - We could improve this using content type.
 - Also, file extensions can be changed, so there is a security issue of potentially executing code through this method.

abstract={The resource limitation of mobile devices causes the problem that the existing image processing software based on the centralized computing mode had difficulty running in mobile devices. A solution is given in the paper by adopting Web service-based image processing method. For one thing, image processing tasks were distributed to service providers' service registry and service requesters. For another, what the service providers should do was only to invocate the specific image processing services provided by service providers. Consequently, Web service-based solution reduces the resource consumption of mobile devices by redistributing image processing tasks. Compared with traditional methods of image processing, Web service-based image processing method has the advantages of loose coupling and component oriented and can take full advantage of the computing resources in heterogeneous network. Thus Web service-based image processing method can effectively solve the resource bottle-neck that traditional image processing software had.},

    \paragraph{Title}
        Cloud-based RAW Photo Editor
    \paragraph{Project Type}
        Graphics and Visualisation
    \paragraph{Description}
        RAW Photo Editing is typically done on one machine, which has fairly high
        levels of performance. This project will investigate the potential of using
        a thin-client approach of editing photos, with the complex image processing
        tasks being done in the cloud.
    \paragraph{Preliminary Preparation}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item An understanding of Image Processing techniques
          \item An understanding of ReactJS and Redux
          \item How can I represent image stage (i.e. store images in an intermediary format)
          \item How can I convert to other files from said intermediary format
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Minimum Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Load DNG RAW files by upload
          \item Exposure adjustment
          \item Noise reduction methods (Gaussian, mean, median)
          \item Web Interface interacting with an image processing server
          \item Non-destructive image adjustment (i.e. no reduction in quality over time)
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Intermediate Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Modern, user friendly User Experience
          \item Spot healing implemented
          \item Haze removal
          \item cropping, rotating and exporting to other formats
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Advanced Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Addressing scalability issues by using a message queue
          \item
        \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Title}
        Web-based RAW Photo Editor
    \paragraph{Project Type}
        Graphics and Visualisation
    \paragraph{Description}
        RAW Photo Editing is typically done on fairly high level hardware, and can
        require a large amount of configuration (for GPUs for example). The aim of
        this project is to make RAW photo editing more accessible by bringing RAW editing
        online, meaning lower end hardware can be used for editing, and less configuration
        is needed.
    \paragraph{Preliminary Preparation}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Raw processing using libraw and dcraw
          \item An understanding of ReactJS and Redux
          \item How can I store raw images and edit them appropriately?
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Minimum Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Load DNG RAW files by upload
          \item Exposure adjustment
          \item Noise reduction methods (Gaussian, mean, median)
          \item Web Interface interacting with an image processing server
          \item Non-destructive image adjustment (i.e. no reduction in quality over time)
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Intermediate Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Modern, user friendly User Experience
          \item Spot healing implemented
          \item Haze removal
          \item cropping, rotating and exporting to other formats
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{Advanced Objectives}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Addressing potential scalability issues
          \item Implement basic previews using built in JPEG to improve QoS
        \end{itemize}
    \paragraph{References}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Pics.io blog (http://blog.pics.io)
          \item JavaScript Image Processing Library (http://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp)
